# A programming language I'm making
### Aim(s)
- This is mainly so that I learn how to make a programming language (esp. how to make the parser as that seems like the trickiest to do without using a parser generator)
- This might evetually be used for my other project, [`pymeowlib`](https://github.com/MarcellPerger1/pymeowlib) (compiling python or some othher text-based language to scratch)
  so most of the keywords and similar have a 1-to-1 scratch equivalent.
  This language would eventually be used:
  - either as an internal representaion (e.g. a function for each of the opcodes of python) so I don't have to implement everythin using drag-and-drop
  - or as the language that can be compiled to scratch
